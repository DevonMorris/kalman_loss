# Formulation

I am not a dietician but I'm going to attempt to model my own weight loss
journey with a simple extended kalman filter.

## States

Here are the following states that I want to estimate

* $x_1$ - "True Weight" (weight with daily fluctuations smoothed)
* $x_2$ - Daily "True Weight" loss or gain
* $x_3$ - Caloric conversion (lbs per thousand calories)
* $x_4$ - Non-active daily calories ([BMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) + [TEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_dynamic_action) + [NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermogenesis))

## Inputs

* $u_1$ - Calories ingested
* $u_2$ - Calories associated with active exercise [EAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermogenesis)

## Measurements

* $z_1$ - Weight as reported by my crappy scale from amazon

## Noise Parameters

This is not a tutorial on [kalman filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter)
, and I'm mainly doing this for myself. So here's what I've chosen my noise
parameters to look like.

### Process noise
$$
Q =
\begin{bmatrix}
1.0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & (0.1)^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & (0.1)^2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 10^2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Input Noise
$$
M =
\begin{bmatrix}
150^2 & 0 \\
0 & 50^2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Measurement Noise
$$
R =
\begin{bmatrix}
(0.1)^2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## State Transition Model

$$
f(x) =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 + x_2 \\
\frac{x_3}{1000}(u_1 - u_2 - x_4)\\
x_3 \\
x_4
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### State Transition Jacobian
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{1000}(u_1 - u_2 - x_4) & -frac{x_3}{1000} \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### State Input Jacobian

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 \\
\frac{x_3}{1000} & -\frac{x_3}{1000} \\
0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Prediction

$$
x^+ = f(x)
$$

Note the special prediction that includes the input noise
$$
P^+ = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}P \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}^\top +
\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}M\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}^\top + Q
$$

## Measurement Model

$$
h(x) =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We will use the typical KF kalman update since this model is linear.

## Initialization

I think the Initialization here is fairly straight-forward. I'm going to use
180lbs (my current weight) as $x_1$, 0 as $x_2$. $1/3.5$ as $x_3$ given the
heuristic that 3500 calories is a lb of fat. 1900 as $x_4$ given some
sloppy calculations I did with data from my apple watch.
